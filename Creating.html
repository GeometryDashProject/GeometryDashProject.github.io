            There are three main goals when it comes to creating levels. To make the best looking levels, To make the best to play
            levels and to make a level with a good mix of both. However, there are exceptions that fall under level series. These being levels
            that start a cretaing trend. This page will show you one of each catagory and some levels that started a trend.

            Dem Travel:<br><br>
            An extremely long level that is really quite easy it's just the fact that it's long that makes it demon. It was inspired
            by a previous level called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGFFrRYheNM">Lonely Travel</a> by Funnygame. Dem travel takes Lonley Travel's graphics and makes the style of level
            more happy and upbeat in turn making the level better graphically. Although the level looks amazing the gameplay is reasonably
            slow and repetitive and can get quite boring to try beat.

            Motion:<br><br>
            A level by Tama_n, Motion was made simply to be a fast fun addictive level. The graphics are simplistic and so is the
            gameplay. What makes this level so great is its completely bug free gameplay filled with quick transitions from
            different game-modes. Not to mention each element of gameplay fit's the song perfectly. Also just to be annoying from
            68% to 78% the level has an annoying dual part to give the player more attempts up deaths.

            Dark Rainbow Rebirth:<br><br>
            The second most objects used in any rated level. Dark Rainbow Rebirth by Knobbelboy is a remake of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOgyYPniif8">Dark Rainbow</a> (also by Knobbelboy). This level
            while also quite hard has addictive gameplay and amazing graphics (if your p.c can handle it). The music fits excellently with the
            level and the detail put into the background is extremely precise. Knobbelboy even states that it took him over 70 hours in the
            editor to build this masterpiece.

            Nine Circles Series:<br><br>
            Originally starting with Nine Circles created by Zobros the Nine Circles series involves a level with somewhat calm or
            slow music at the start. Then the music "drop" hits and the entire level goes all crazy and epileptic with the wave game-mode.
            Some of the Nine Circles levels have a small section after the drop as-well. This level series is currently quite overused but
            the <a href="http://geometry-dash-fan.wikia.com/wiki/Nine_Circles_Levels"/>trend<a/> is dying down.

        <p id="create">
            Ice Cream Series:<br><br>
            A short level series by multiple creators. The Ice Cream series are simply colourful levels all with a colourful and
            happy feel to them. The three levels are Chocolate, Strawberry and Vanilla. I have no doubt another one will
            be coming soon as the levels are extremely enjoyable to play because of the wonderful music, graphics and relatively bug free
            gameplay.
