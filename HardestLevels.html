                Geometry Dash has two main goals for those players ready to commit a lot of time into it.
                Either make the best looking levels, or beat the hardest levels. This page is dedicated to the hardest levels
                ever created and rated demon. <a href= "http://gdforum.freeforums.net/thread/5339/official-extreme-insane-demons-records">Click here to see</a>
                the list of the top 50 hardest levels and all who have completed it. This list will be the 10 hardest levels and a brief summary of each.

            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Catalysm:<br><br>
                Cataclysm by Gboy is the oldest of all ten of these levels although it was updated more recently with a few changes to make
                the level harder than it was before. Cataclysm is a hell themed level with many tight spaces and millisecond precise timing
                in certain parts. However some parts of the level are mostly memory and aren't too hard to do which makes this level number 10.
                It was created in update 1.9 but then buffed in 2.0 and verified by Riot. This brought it up in difficulty but it's still <only></only>
                10th.

            <p id="Hardlevel">
                The Hell Factory:<br><br>
                The Hell Factory created by Team N2, a team of 20 people from around the world (mostly from asia) set out to create
                the hardest and best looking levels ever conceived. When the hell factory was released it was the second hardest level
                only behind BloodBath. The level is now about a year old and has been surpassed by other levels. This levels main
                challenges are the flying parts which involve a large amount of control and Ryan LC's mini cube part. You can find out who made
                what part by looking out for the names imbedded in the level.
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Red World Rebirth:<br><br>
                A remake of <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9WiA4_KaK8">Red World</a> by Neptune and SaRy. It was Remade by Hinds,
                Findexi and Viprin to be verified by Riot. Besides the ship parts the level is mostly memory and timing. You just need to remember
                the pattern. The ship sections are the hardest ship sections of any verified level especially the straight flying in
                the middle that lasts for about 5 seconds. It's a lot harder than it looks.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Plasma Pulse 3:<br><br>
                The third and by far hardest instalment of the Plasma Pule Series by Smokes and GironDavid. It's a very fast paced
                level with a lot of precise timing and tight spaces. What makes this level really hard is the constant switched
                between gameplay and speeds. However, a fourth and final sequel to the Plasma Pulse series is coming soon and it's
                meant to be far harder than all previous.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Betrayal of Fate:<br><br>
                Betrayal of Fate is an unrelated sequel to A Bizarre Phantasm. With the exact same some and a similar
                yet slightly darker colour style. Betrayal of Fate utilises constant tight spaces to make the level insane.
                Alongside the many memory parts scattered along the level to task the player's brain while playing and
                to increase stress levels. Finally just to add insult to injury there is a three spike waiting at the end. All these bring it to number 6.<br><br>
            <p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                A Bizarre Phantasm:<br><br>
                Betrayal of Fate's unrelated prequel. A Bizarre Phantasm is Team N2's second and hardest level with a cold and icy
                feel to it. A Bizarre Phantasm uses tight spaces which need accurate timings and a quick trigger finger. To increase difficulty
                the hardest parts are towards the end making it harder as it goes along. Finally to end memory sequence with 21 sections with three
                keys. Collect the wrong key or miss a key and the end won't open.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Conical Depression:<br><br>
                Conical Depression by KrazyMan50 is literally just made up of insane cube and ship challenges with basic 1.0 decoration.
                However, the gameplay is 2.0. Including the hardest part of any of these levels being the mini wave part right at the very
                start. To end it's the Stereo Madness ship part with a mini wave. A level with no memory. Just skill and awkward timings.
                All this brings it into number 4.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Phobos:<br><br>
                A nerfed (made easier) version of the original Phobos as it was too hard to beat. Many say the original
                <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxWPh-tS7Uc"/>(View Here)</a> is harder than Bloodbath but it's highly
                unlikely it will ever be beaten legitimately. Phobos includes every gameplay element from 1.9 and a bit from 2.0 when the level
                was nerfed to the extreme. The original intention of the level was to be harder than Bloodbath. It didn't quite turn out right
                but it's still the third hardest level ever.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Sakupen Hell:<br><br>
                Coming in at a short 52 seconds Sakupen Hell created by Noobas was initialy made to be harder than Cataclysm to
                be the hardest level ever because at the time Cataclysm was the hardest level. It was initially hacked by Noobas and because
                of this it wasn't rated demon. Noobas then took his copy down and almost a year later it was verified by TrusTa. Sakupen
                Hell took the wave to an extreme level requiring insanely precise timing. Many say it's harder than Bloodbath but for now its's
                number two.   
            </p>
            <p id="Hardlevel">
                Bloodbath:<br><br>
                With only 17 survivors in over a year of being available Bloodbath tops the chart as the hardest demon. Bloobath as
                you could probably guess is a red/hell themed demon with extremely hard and fast gameplay. It uses the song Speed of Light by
                DimRain47 as the song has many different parts to it giving the level many different styles of gameplay to fit to the music.
                Although a longer harder version of Bloodbath called <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=334nzZVRuJI"/>Bloodlust</a> is being worked on by a player called Quasar who 
                has beaten Bloodbath. This will be the hardest demon ever if verified.
