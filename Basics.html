                <p class="Basicsp1">
                    Ever since Geometry Dash was released in August 2013 more and more official levels have been added
                    along with gradual updates to the game. Each update brought new features to the game and one or two 
                    levels.
                </p>
                <p class="basicslevelsum">
                    Geometry Dash's official levels are rated with the visual faces each one getting progressively
                    more angry as the levels get harder. Each level is also awarded stars for it's completion. These are
                    used to unlock new icons and generally just to show how much you have played of the game.
                    Although the star limit is ten for community made levels the Official levels go up to fifteen stars.
                    Each official level also has three coins also used to unlock icons. The majority of the time players
                    have to go out of their way to collect one of these coins.
                </p>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Geometry Dash is made up of (currently) 20 official levels made by the developer and a
                    community based workshop where users can make any form of level they want.
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Stereo Madness:<br><br><br><br>
                    The first of twenty and the easiest of the initial seven added in the first games release.
                    Stereo madness is the easiest level introducing the basic concepts of the game being the cube and ship.
                    Just like the other six levels introduced in 1.0 Stereo Madness has very limited decoration and
                    gameplay mechanics.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Back on Track:<br><br><br><br>
                    Similar to Stereo madness with the only difference in gameplay being the introduction of the jump pad.
                    The jump pad launches the players' icon into the air about twice as high as a normal cube jump. It is 
                    also the hardest level ever created! <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClW9MUeq6ug">Click to see.</a>That joke escalated too much!<br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Polargeist:<br><br><br><br>
                    Polargeist uses the gameplay mechanics from the first two levels with the added mechanic of the jump ring (a floating
                    orb that only activates if you click while your icon is over it). Polargeist also introduces the black background
                    which is used a lot to make levels more confusing. In Polargeist it doesn't really affect gameplay.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Dry Out:<br><br><br><br>
                    Slightly harder than the levels before it Dry Out introduces only one new mechanic. The gravity portals change 
                    whether the gravity of the level is going up or down. Only used with the cube in this level. The gravity portal
                    with the ship is not introduced until Jumper. To help increase difficulty Dry Out uses all the mechanics from 
                    the previous levels giving the player more to memorise.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Base after Base:<br><br><br><br>
                    Base after Base is incredibly similar to Dry Out only the gameplay is harder and the ship has to fly through
                    some tight spaces.<br><br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Can't let Go:<br><br><br><br>
                    Can't let Go is the first level to make the background and gameplay change appropriate to the music. Dry Out and
                    Base after Base also did it but not to the standard Can't let Go did. It also introduced the first example of deception
                    with a jump near the start having three jump rings you can use but only one is correct. It is also the easiest level to
                    have a mini jump pad in the process of getting a coin but it didn't get introduced in Can't let Go as the coins were
                    added in a later update.
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Jumper:<br><br><br><br>
                    In my opinion the most playful level. Jumper incorporates the gravity portal with the ship and the level is styled
                    so that your character is constantly moving and active. It is a big step up in difficulty compared to Cant let Go.<br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Time Machine:<br><br><br><br>
                    The first level to be added in an update and not with the initial release. Time machine is a huge increase in difficulty
                    compared to jumper. Time machine involves a large amount of timing in jumps, some tight spaces for the ship to fly through 
                    and on top of all that a new portal. This portal changes the direction of level scroll from left to right to right to left
                    and vice versa. This makes the level far more confusing.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Cycles:<br><br><br><br>
                    Update 1.2 brought a new level and new form. The level Cycles which is similar difficulty to Time Machine brought the
                    Gravity Ball to the game. The gravity ball changes its gravity every time it is clicked when on a solid platform.<br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    xStep:<br><br><br><br>
                    xStep and some major graphical improvements to the game came along with 1.3. xStep is the first insane level and
                    the first level to introduce gravity pads and jump rings. xStep includes new obstacles like a full black spike layer
                    clouds and lots of other details. Compared to its older brother Cycles, xStep is a massive improvement graphically.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc"> 
                    Clutterfunk:<br><br><br><br>
                    1.4 introduced some minor graphical improvements, a few new unlockable icons for the ship and the mini portal.
                    All these new features were introduced into Clutterfunk including unlocking one of the ships by finishing the level.
                    Clutterfunk used tight, small spaces to introduce the mini icons.<br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Theory of Everything:<br><br><br><br>
                    Theory of Everything was introduced in 1.5 with the new addition of the UFO whose mechanic is very similar to
                    flappy bird. Tap to boost the UFO up a small amount or the UFO keeps falling. Theory of Everything also brought
                    some new graphics to the game. For example black dead grass which is actually spikes. Although Theory of Everything is
                    rated harder than Clutterfunk a vast majority of players see it as easy as Cycles.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc"> 
                    Electroman Adventures:<br><br><br><br>
                    The first level not increasing difficulty released in 1.6. 1.6 was mainly focused on graphics and icons. Electroman
                    Adventures introduced breakable blocks when gone through but they stay intact when walked on. 1.6 also brought collectable
                    coins to every level as an extra acheivment. <br><br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Clubstep:<br><br><br><br>
                    The first Demon level also introduced in 1.6 was a massive step up in difficulty from any other official level.
                    It introduced fading blocks that were visible when entering and exiting the screen but are near invisible when next to them.
                    Clubstep also familiarised the now common decoration in user made levels of flying through the head of a demon as an obstacle.
                    Even now over two years later Clubstep is still the second hardest official level and a staple level for updates to come.
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Electrodynamix:<br><br><br><br>
                    Just a quick warning if you have any form of epilepsy or siezures I don't reccomend watching this level. With 1.7 came new colour
                    mechanics, new backgrounds, pleanty of new icons and a speed change mechanic. It acted like a portal but in the form of an arrow
                    instead. All these were combined together in the most epilectic official level Electrodynamix.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Hexagon Force:<br><br><br><br>
                    If one character to control wasn't hard enough 1.8 brought the dual portal to the game. Splitting your icons into two
                    yet they both respond to one click. They can be controled by two seperate button on P.C if the level is built that way.
                    1.8 like most updates brought some more graphical improvements to the game and sloped blocks which make smoother gameplay.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Blast Processing:<br><br><br><br>
                    Many consider this to be the best update ever for Geometry Dash. Mainly because it added so many features to the creator studio rather than the official levels. The wave was the new
                    gamemode for this update. Its the only gamemode where the large and mini icons have vastly different gameplay styles. The wave 
                    goes up and down at an angle but the angles are different depending on size. Blast Processing introduced the wave machanic.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Theory of Everything 2:<br><br><br><br>
                    By far the easiest offical demon Theory of Everything 2 (TOE2) introduced all 1.0-1.9 features except for the switch way portal
                    which was only used in 5 levels. All these features were combined with an awesome song and an extremely memory oriented level. TOE2
                    the invisible and fake blocks used in clubstep and other levels and ramped it up to the max.<br><br>
                <p class="basicsleveldesc">
                    Geometrical Dominator:<br><br><br><br>
                    2.0. The invasion. Geometrical Dominator brought the Robot gamemode and many other graphical features to the game. The robot operates similarly to the cube however its jump
                    height and length varies on how long you hold the button. Geometrical Dominator also introduced a new green orb which switches gravity gradually rather than instantly like the 
                    blue orbs. 2.0 also added many more color options to levels and the editor making it a very colourful update.
                <p class="basicsleveldesc"> 
                    Deadlocked:<br><br><br><br>
                    Epic. Deadlocked is by far the headest official level with moving objects, loads of constant speed changes and a mini boss fight.
                    I don't need to explain any more. Just watch it!<br><br><br>
