                    Geometry Dash is a game created by the Sweden-Based Developer Robert Topala 
                    who also published the game under his business RobTop Games. 
                    It is a rythm based 2D platformer where your character is constantly moving
                    and your goal is to avoid all the obstacles to reach the end of the level.

                    The game concept is incredibly simple but in practice it proves to be so much more.
                    Origionally for iOS and Android devices it has now been added to P.C and Mac through
                    the game store "Steam". The controls are simple. Click, Tap, Push. It just depends on what your device supports. 
                    When put into practice simple clicking is not so simple.
                    New players take hundreds of attempts to complete level one and good players take
                    tens of thousands of attempts to beat the hardest of levels.
